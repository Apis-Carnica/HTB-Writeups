## Welcome
My [latest writeup](Mirai.md) talks about the Mirai machine on HackTheBox; 
the page found here is the minimal markup document, but the more in-depth and attractive PDF can be found 
[**here**](https://github.com/nateac1/HTB-Writeups/blob/master/Mirai-en.pdf).  


Make a note that this is the English version; Spanish and Japanese versions are in the works!  

Hacer una nota que escribo versiones de mi tutorials en Español y Japonés tambien!

これは英語版であることに注意してください。 スペイン語版と日本語版が作業中です!  


Otherwise, feel free to make yourself at home and enjoy the writeups that I publish here. I primarily work on PDF versions of writeups which
you can find in the [master branch](https://github.com/nateac1/HTB-Writeups) and are generally better quality than what I publish here on the site.  
Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope you learn something from my Writeups!

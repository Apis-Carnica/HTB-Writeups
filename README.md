# HTB-Writeups
This is a repository for all my unofficial HackTheBox writeups. This is where logic and college education go to die.
***
If you're having trouble opening these PDFs, make sure you're using the root
hash in the shadow file (that would be the set of characters after the first
colon). As of October 2020, all future writeups will be encrypted in this
manner; if you have any issues opening the writeups, feel free to contact me or
open an issue for this repository. Happy hacking!
